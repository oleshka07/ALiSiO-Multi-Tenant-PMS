# World2Meet

This guide walks through creating a channel connection between Channex and World2Meet over the API: discovering the adapter, reading the hotels and contracts on the World2Meet account, validating the credentials, reading the rooms and rates on both sides, building the mapping, and creating and activating the connection.

A **channel connection** (a *channel*) links rate plans of a Channex property to rooms and rates on the OTA side. Once the connection is active, Channex pushes availability, rates and restrictions to World2Meet and receives bookings back.

Every OTA has its own API and data model, so the connection settings and the mapping settings differ per channel. The flow below is shared by most channels (Booking.com, Expedia, Agoda, Open Channel–based OTAs and others); the payloads shown are the World2Meet ones. Airbnb is the exception — it requires an OAuth authorization step and is covered by a separate guide.

All endpoints require authentication with an API key, sent in the `user-api-key` header.

### The flow at a glance

1. Get the adapter descriptor — what settings and mapping fields World2Meet needs.
2. Collect the credentials and get the connection details — the hotels and contracts on the account.
3. Pick a hotel and contract, add its values to the settings, and run a test connection.
4. Get the mapping details — the rooms and rates on the World2Meet side.
5. Collect the Channex side — the property, its room types and rate plans.
6. Build the mapping structure.
7. Create the connection.
8. Activate it.

### 1. Get the adapter descriptor

Each channel is described by an **adapter descriptor**: the settings it needs (`params`) and the per-mapping fields it needs (`rate_params`).

```
GET /api/v1/channels/adapter?code=World2Meet
```

The full catalog of adapters is available at `GET /api/v1/channels/list`.

          }
        ]
      },

      "is_primary": { "position": 4, "title": "Primary Rate", "type": "boolean" }
    }
  }
}
```

What to read from it:

* **`params`** — the connection settings to collect from the user. Each entry describes one field: `title` (English label), `type` (`string`, `password`, `boolean`, `select`), `position` (ordering for a UI), `default`, `options` (for `select` fields) and conditional display `rules`.
* **`rate_params`** — the fields each rate plan mapping must carry (step 6), described the same way.

For World2Meet, the settings to collect from the user are the account credentials — **`user`** and **`password`**. The remaining settings have sensible defaults (see the settings reference); the hotel and contract values are selected from the connection details in the next step.

### 2. Get the connection details

For World2Meet the connection details come first: they list the hotels and contracts on the account, and the connection's remaining settings are taken from the contract you pick.

```
POST /api/v1/channels/connection_details
```

```json
{
  "channel": "World2Meet",
  "settings": {
    "user": "username",
    "password": "password"
  }
}
```

`channel` is the adapter code from the descriptor; `settings` is the object built from `params`.

Response (abridged):

```json
{
  "data": {
    "type": "connection_details",
    "attributes": {
      "hotels": [
        {
          "id": "36516",
          "title": "Sunrise Beach Resort",
          "contracts": [
            {
              "active": true,
              "contract_sequence": "299745",
              "contract_name": "GENERAL SHORT STAY",
              "contract_start_date": "2026-02-17",
              "contract_end_date": "2028-07-31",
              "price_type": "Recommended",
              "boards": [
                { "id": "1", "title": "Half Board" },
                { "id": "2", "title": "Bed & Breakfast" },
                { "id": "4", "title": "Full Board" },
                { "id": "6", "title": "Room Only" }
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Each hotel carries its World2Meet `id`, its `title` and its `contracts`. Each contract carries:

| Field                 | Description                                          |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `active`              | Whether the contract is currently active.            |
| `contract_sequence`   | Contract ID on the World2Meet side.                  |
| `contract_name`       | Contract name.                                       |
| `contract_start_date` | First date the contract covers.                      |
| `contract_end_date`   | Last date the contract covers.                       |
| `price_type`          | Price type of the contract: `Recommended` or `Cost`. |
| `boards`              | Board types the contract covers.                     |

Pick the hotel and the contract to connect, and add their values to the connection settings — they are sent with every following request and stored on the connection:

```json
{
  "hotel_id": 36516,
  "contract_sequence": "299745",
  "price_type": "Recommended",
  "contract_start_date": "2026-02-17",
  "contract_end_date": "2028-07-31"
}
```

### 3. Test the connection

Before creating anything, validate the full settings — credentials plus the selected hotel and contract — with a test connection:

```
POST /api/v1/channels/test_connection
```

```json
{
  "channel": "World2Meet",
  "settings": {
    "user": "username",
    "password": "password",
    "hotel_id": 36516,
    "contract_sequence": "299745",
    "price_type": "Recommended",
    "contract_start_date": "2026-02-17",
    "contract_end_date": "2028-07-31"
  }
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "success": true,
    "errors": null
  }
}
```

`success: true` means the credentials are correct and the hotel is ready for connection on the World2Meet side. On failure the response is still `200 OK` with `success: false` — check the `success` field, not the status code.

### 4. Get the mapping details

Next, fetch the rooms and rates the hotel exposes on the World2Meet side:

```
POST /api/v1/channels/mapping_details
```

The payload is the same as for the test connection:

```json
{
  "channel": "World2Meet",
  "settings": {
    "user": "username",
    "password": "password",
    "hotel_id": 36516,
    "contract_sequence": "299745",
    "price_type": "Recommended",
    "contract_start_date": "2026-02-17",
    "contract_end_date": "2028-07-31"
  }
}
```

Response (abridged):

```json
{
  "data": {
    "pricing_type": "Standard",
    "rooms": [
      {
        "id": "84",
        "title": "STANDARD STUDIO GARDEN VIEW (1+0)",
        "rates": [
          {
            "id": "1",
            "title": "Half Board",
            "readonly": false
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "id": "85",
        "title": "STANDARD STUDIO GARDEN VIEW (2+0)",
        "rates": [
          {
            "id": "1",
            "title": "Half Board",
            "readonly": false
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "id": "422",
        "title": "DELUXE SUITE SEA VIEW (2+0)",
        "rates": [
          {
            "id": "1",
            "title": "Half Board",
            "readonly": false
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Every channel returns its own mapping-details shape; this one is World2Meet's.

**`pricing_type`** — the hotel's pricing model. `Standard` is per-room pricing: one price per rate.

**`rooms`** — the rooms available for mapping. World2Meet lists each occupancy option of a room as its own room entry, with the occupancy in the title: `(2+0)` is two adults and no children. Each room carries:

| Field   | Description                                        |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`    | Room ID on the World2Meet side.                    |
| `title` | Room title, including the occupancy it is sold at. |
| `rates` | Rates of the room.                                 |

Each rate carries:

| Field      | Description                                           |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`       | Rate ID on the World2Meet side.                       |
| `title`    | Rate title.                                           |
| `readonly` | Whether the rate is read-only on the World2Meet side. |

The same rate can be offered on several rooms: it appears under each room it is sold on, and a mapping always targets one room + rate pair.

### 5. Collect the Channex side

World2Meet connections are one-to-one: **one connection maps exactly one Channex property to one World2Meet hotel**. Pick the property to connect, then fetch its room types and rate plans through the `options` endpoints:

```
GET /api/v1/room_types/options?filter[property_id]={property_id}
GET /api/v1/rate_plans/options?filter[property_id]={property_id}
```

### 6. Build the mapping structure

The mapping is a list of `rate_plans` entries, one per (Channex rate plan → World2Meet room/rate) pair:

```json
{
  "rate_plan_id": "a35f1fd4-63c6-4fbc-8fbe-359869bd9958",
  "settings": {
    "rate_plan_code": "1",
    "room_type_code": "85",
    "readonly": false,
    "is_primary": true
  }
}
```

**`rate_plan_id`** — the Channex rate plan UUID (from step 5).

**`settings`** — the fields declared by `rate_params` in the adapter descriptor:

| Field            | Description                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `rate_plan_code` | Rate ID on the World2Meet side.                                                                                                                                                     |
| `room_type_code` | Room ID on the World2Meet side.                                                                                                                                                     |
| `readonly`       | The `readonly` flag of the rate, copied from the mapping details.                                                                                                                   |
| `is_primary`     | Whether this mapping is the primary one for its room + rate pair. The primary mapping sends availability and restrictions along with prices; non-primary mappings send prices only. |

Mark **exactly one mapping of each room + rate pair** as primary. Since World2Meet lists each occupancy option of a room as its own room entry, create one mapping per occupancy option you want to sell.

A full mapping for one rate sold on a room at occupancies 2 and 1:

```json
[
  {
    "rate_plan_id": "a35f1fd4-63c6-4fbc-8fbe-359869bd9958",
    "settings": {
      "rate_plan_code": "1",
      "room_type_code": "85",
      "readonly": false,
      "is_primary": true
    }
  },
  {
    "rate_plan_id": "2a0c416b-d8e6-4950-b52e-e7821030fd9d",
    "settings": {
      "rate_plan_code": "1",
      "room_type_code": "84",
      "readonly": false,
      "is_primary": false
    }
  }
]
```

### 7. Create the connection

```
POST /api/v1/channels
```

The payload is wrapped in a `channel` key:

```json
{
  "channel": {
    "channel": "World2Meet",
    "group_id": "60674dd6-1aeb-4c41-9e0c-8ffb378a4570",
    "title": "World2Meet Channel",
    "properties": ["acb388d9-546b-42fc-9ae2-baf00e7f0d8c"],
    "settings": {
      "user": "username",
      "password": "password",
      "min_stay_type": "Arrival",
      "booking_amount_settings": "With Commission",
      "hotel_id": 36516,
      "contract_sequence": "299745",
      "price_type": "Recommended",
      "contract_start_date": "2026-02-17",
      "contract_end_date": "2028-07-31"
    },
    "rate_plans": [
      {
        "rate_plan_id": "a35f1fd4-63c6-4fbc-8fbe-359869bd9958",
        "settings": {
          "rate_plan_code": "1",
          "room_type_code": "85",
          "readonly": false,
          "is_primary": true
        }
      },
      {
        "rate_plan_id": "2a0c416b-d8e6-4950-b52e-e7821030fd9d",
        "settings": {
          "rate_plan_code": "1",
          "room_type_code": "84",
          "readonly": false,
          "is_primary": false
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

| Field        | Description                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `channel`    | The adapter code from the descriptor.                                                                                                                                        |
| `group_id`   | UUID of the group the connection belongs to. Required.                                                                                                                       |
| `title`      | Connection title. Optional — generated from the channel and property names when omitted.                                                                                     |
| `properties` | UUIDs of the connected properties. One property for World2Meet.                                                                                                              |
| `settings`   | The connection settings — the credentials built from `params` plus the hotel and contract values from the connection details, the same object the test connection validated. |
| `rate_plans` | The mapping structure from step 6. Optional — mappings can also be added later by updating the connection.                                                                   |

The response is `201 Created` with the channel connection resource (abridged):

```json
{
  "data": {
    "type": "channel",
    "id": "7d1f3c5a-92b4-4e6f-a8c1-3b5d97e2f410",
    "attributes": {

      },
      "rate_plans": [
        {
          "id": "b8d63f1a-42e9-4c57-a90b-6e2c85d1f374",
          "rate_plan_id": "a35f1fd4-63c6-4fbc-8fbe-359869bd9958",
          "settings": {
            "rate_plan_code": "1",
            "room_type_code": "85",
            "readonly": false,
            "is_primary": true
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Note that the connection **starts disabled**: `is_active` in the create payload has no effect — a new connection is always created with `is_active: false`. Activation is a separate, explicit step.

### 8. Activate the connection

```
POST /api/v1/channels/{channel_id}/activate
```

No payload. Activation requires the connection to have at least one property and at least one rate plan mapping; activating starts the synchronization — Channex pushes the full current availability, rates and restrictions to World2Meet and begins receiving bookings.

The counterpart is `POST /api/v1/channels/{channel_id}/deactivate`, which stops the synchronization but keeps the connection and its mappings.

### Updating a connection

```
PUT /api/v1/channels/{channel_id}
```

The payload has the same shape as for create (wrapped in `channel`). Two rules matter:

* **`channel` cannot be changed** — a different adapter code is rejected.
* **`rate_plans`, when present, replaces the whole mapping set.** A stored mapping missing from the list is removed, and a mapping sent with `settings: null` is removed as well. Omit `rate_plans` entirely to keep the stored mappings.

### Deleting a connection

```
DELETE /api/v1/channels/{channel_id}
```

An active connection must be deactivated first. Deleting removes the connection and all its mappings; bookings received through it are kept.

### Actions

The World2Meet adapter declares no connection actions — `actions` is empty on the descriptor and on every World2Meet connection.

### World2Meet settings reference

The full set of connection `settings` for World2Meet. First, the fields declared by `params`:

| Setting                    | Description                                                                                                                                                    |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `min_stay_type`            | How the minimum stay restriction is applied: `Arrival` (counted from the arrival date) or `Through` (applied to every stayed-through date). Default `Arrival`. |
| `email`                    | The email address the notifications go to.                                                                                                                     |
| `send_email_notifications` | When `true`, Channex sends a notification about each booking.                                                                                                  |

And the fields selected from the connection details (step 2):

| Setting               | Description                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `hotel_id`            | ID of the connected World2Meet hotel. Required.                                                                                                    |
| `contract_sequence`   | ID of the connected contract. Required.                                                                                                            |
