# Mr and Mrs Smith

This guide walks through creating a channel connection between Channex and Mr & Mrs Smith over the API: discovering the adapter, validating the hotel credentials, reading the rooms and rates on both sides, building the mapping, and creating and activating the connection.

A **channel connection** (a *channel*) links rate plans of a Channex property to rooms and rates on the OTA side. Once the connection is active, Channex pushes availability, rates and restrictions to Mr & Mrs Smith and receives bookings back.

Every OTA has its own API and data model, so the connection settings and the mapping settings differ per channel. The flow below is shared by most channels (Booking.com, Expedia, Agoda, Open Channel–based OTAs and others); the payloads shown are the Mr & Mrs Smith ones. Airbnb is the exception — it requires an OAuth authorization step and is covered by a separate guide.

All endpoints require authentication with an API key, sent in the `user-api-key` header.

### The flow at a glance

1. Get the adapter descriptor — what settings and mapping fields Mr & Mrs Smith needs.
2. Collect the settings from the user and run a test connection.
3. Get the mapping details — the rooms and rates on the Mr & Mrs Smith side.
4. Collect the Channex side — the property, its room types and rate plans.
5. Build the mapping structure.
6. Create the connection.
7. Activate it.

### 1. Get the adapter descriptor

Each channel is described by an **adapter descriptor**: the settings it needs (`params`) and the per-mapping fields it needs (`rate_params`).

```
GET /api/v1/channels/adapter?code=MrAndMrsSmith
```

The full catalog of adapters is available at `GET /api/v1/channels/list`.

Response (abridged):

```json
{
  "data": {
    "code": "MrAndMrsSmith",
    "title": "Mr & Mrs Smith",
    "kind": "meta",
    "actions": [],
    "params": {
      "hotel_id": {
        "position": 0,
        "type": "string",
        "title": "Hotel ID"
      },
      "email": {
        "position": 1,
        "type": "string",
        "title": "Property Email",
        "rules": [
          {
            "apply": "hidden",
            "when": false,
            "influence_field": "send_email_notifications",
            "with_value": ""
          }
        ]
      },
      "send_email_notifications": {
        "default": false,
        "position": 2,
        "type": "boolean",
        "title": "Send Property Notification"
      },
      "max_stay_type": {
        "default": "Arrival",
        "position": 3,
        "type": "switch",
        "options": ["Arrival", "Through"],
        "title": "Max Stay Type"
      },
      "booking_amount_settings": {
        "default": "Gross Amount",
        "position": 4,
        "type": "select",
        "options": ["Gross Amount", "Net Amount"],
        "title": "Booking Amount"
      }
    },
    "rate_params": {
      "rate_plan_code": { "position": 0, "title": "Rate", "type": "string" },
      "room_type_code": { "position": 1, "title": "Room", "type": "string" }
    }
  }
}
```

What to read from it:

* **`params`** — the connection settings to collect from the user. Each entry describes one field: `title` (English label), `type` (`string`, `integer`, `boolean`, `select`, `switch`, `hidden`), `position` (ordering for a UI), `default`, `options` (for `select` and `switch` fields) and conditional display `rules`.
* **`rate_params`** — the fields each rate plan mapping must carry (step 5), described the same way.

For Mr & Mrs Smith, the only setting to collect from the user is **`hotel_id`** — the Mr & Mrs Smith Hotel ID. The remaining settings have sensible defaults; see the settings reference.

### 2. Test the connection

Before creating anything, validate the collected settings with a test connection:

```
POST /api/v1/channels/test_connection
```

```json
{
  "channel": "MrAndMrsSmith",
  "settings": {
    "hotel_id": "8734"
  }
}
```

`channel` is the adapter code from the descriptor; `settings` is the object built from `params`.

Response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "success": true,
    "errors": null
  }
}
```

`success: true` means the credentials are correct and the hotel is ready for connection on the Mr & Mrs Smith side. On failure the response is still `200 OK` with `success: false` — check the `success` field, not the status code.

### 3. Get the mapping details

Next, fetch the rooms and rates the hotel exposes on the Mr & Mrs Smith side:

```
POST /api/v1/channels/mapping_details
```

The payload is the same as for the test connection:

```json
{
  "channel": "MrAndMrsSmith",
  "settings": {
    "hotel_id": "8734"
  }
}
```

Response (abridged):

```json
{
  "data": {
    "pricing_type": "Standard",
    "rooms": [
      {
        "id": "19645",
        "title": "Gallery (Republic Street)",
        "rates": [
          {
            "id": "15243",
            "title": "Standard rate",
            "charge_type": "per_room",
            "derived_rate_plan_ids": ["95556"]
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "id": "19646",
        "title": "Library (Republic Street)",
        "rates": [
          {
            "id": "15243",
            "title": "Standard rate",
            "charge_type": "per_room",
            "derived_rate_plan_ids": ["95556"]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Every channel returns its own mapping-details shape; this one is Mr & Mrs Smith's.

**`pricing_type`** — the hotel's pricing model. Mr & Mrs Smith uses per-room pricing only, so it is always `Standard`: each rate carries one price per room.

**`rooms`** — the rooms available for mapping. Each room carries:

| Field   | Description                         |
| ------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `id`    | Room ID on the Mr & Mrs Smith side. |
| `title` | Room title.                         |
| `rates` | Rates of the room.                  |

Each rate carries:

| Field                   | Description                                                              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `id`                    | Rate ID on the Mr & Mrs Smith side.                                      |
| `title`                 | Rate title.                                                              |
| `charge_type`           | How the rate is charged: `per_room` — one price per room per night.      |
| `derived_rate_plan_ids` | IDs of the rates derived from this rate; empty for rates that have none. |

The same rate can be offered on several rooms: it appears under each room it is sold on, and a mapping always targets one room + rate pair.

Only parent rates are listed. Rates that Mr & Mrs Smith derives from another rate do not appear as rates of a room themselves — their IDs are collected in the parent's `derived_rate_plan_ids`, and when the connection is created or its mappings updated, Channex records known mappings for them automatically, so bookings arriving on a derived rate are allocated to the parent's mapped rate plan.

### 4. Collect the Channex side

Mr & Mrs Smith connections are one-to-one: **one connection maps exactly one Channex property to one Mr & Mrs Smith hotel**. Pick the property to connect, then fetch its room types and rate plans through the `options` endpoints:

```
GET /api/v1/room_types/options?filter[property_id]={property_id}
GET /api/v1/rate_plans/options?filter[property_id]={property_id}
```

### 5. Build the mapping structure

The mapping is a list of `rate_plans` entries, one per (Channex rate plan → Mr & Mrs Smith room/rate) pair:

```json
{
  "rate_plan_id": "a35f1fd4-63c6-4fbc-8fbe-359869bd9958",
  "settings": {
    "room_type_code": "19645",
    "rate_plan_code": "15243",
    "pricing_type": "Standard",
    "primary_occ": true
  }
}
```

**`rate_plan_id`** — the Channex rate plan UUID (from step 4).

**`settings`** — the mapping fields:

| Field            | Description                                                                                                |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `room_type_code` | Room ID on the Mr & Mrs Smith side.                                                                        |
| `rate_plan_code` | Rate ID on the Mr & Mrs Smith side.                                                                        |
| `pricing_type`   | The hotel's pricing model — copy it from the mapping details; always `Standard` for Mr & Mrs Smith.        |
| `primary_occ`    | When `true`, the mapping sends availability and restrictions along with prices; when `false`, prices only. |

A full mapping for one Mr & Mrs Smith rate sold on two rooms:

```json
[
  {
    "rate_plan_id": "a35f1fd4-63c6-4fbc-8fbe-359869bd9958",
    "settings": {
      "room_type_code": "19645",
      "rate_plan_code": "15243",
      "pricing_type": "Standard",
      "primary_occ": true
    }
  },
  {
    "rate_plan_id": "2a0c416b-d8e6-4950-b52e-e7821030fd9d",
    "settings": {
      "room_type_code": "19646",
      "rate_plan_code": "15243",
      "pricing_type": "Standard",
      "primary_occ": true
    }
  }
]
```

### 6. Create the connection

```
POST /api/v1/channels
```

The payload is wrapped in a `channel` key:

```json
{
  "channel": {
    "channel": "MrAndMrsSmith",
    "group_id": "60674dd6-1aeb-4c41-9e0c-8ffb378a4570",
    "title": "Smith Republic Street",
    "properties": ["acb388d9-546b-42fc-9ae2-baf00e7f0d8c"],
    "settings": {
      "hotel_id": "8734",
      "max_stay_type": "Arrival"
    },
    "rate_plans": [
      {
        "rate_plan_id": "a35f1fd4-63c6-4fbc-8fbe-359869bd9958",
        "settings": {
          "room_type_code": "19645",
          "rate_plan_code": "15243",
          "pricing_type": "Standard",
          "primary_occ": true
        }
      },
      {
        "rate_plan_id": "2a0c416b-d8e6-4950-b52e-e7821030fd9d",
        "settings": {
          "room_type_code": "19646",
          "rate_plan_code": "15243",
          "pricing_type": "Standard",
          "primary_occ": true
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

| Field        | Description                                                                                                |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `channel`    | The adapter code from the descriptor.                                                                      |
| `group_id`   | UUID of the group the connection belongs to. Required.                                                     |
| `title`      | Connection title. Optional — generated from the channel and property names when omitted.                   |
| `properties` | UUIDs of the connected properties. One property for Mr & Mrs Smith.                                        |
| `settings`   | The connection settings built from `params` — the same object the test connection validated.               |
| `rate_plans` | The mapping structure from step 5. Optional — mappings can also be added later by updating the connection. |

The response is `201 Created` with the channel connection resource (abridged):

```json

      },
      "rate_plans": [
        {
          "id": "9d7e45b3-367b-4286-a081-17a6c8d3c62e",
          "rate_plan_id": "a35f1fd4-63c6-4fbc-8fbe-359869bd9958",
          "settings": {
            "room_type_code": "19645",
            "rate_plan_code": "15243",
            "pricing_type": "Standard",
            "primary_occ": true
          }
        },
        {
          "id": "0f6fe97e-ab8b-4f0b-a1cd-dc3500f18295",
          "rate_plan_id": "2a0c416b-d8e6-4950-b52e-e7821030fd9d",
          "settings": {
            "room_type_code": "19646",
            "rate_plan_code": "15243",
            "pricing_type": "Standard",
            "primary_occ": true
          }
        }
      ]
    },
    "relationships": {
      "group": {
        "data": { "id": "60674dd6-1aeb-4c41-9e0c-8ffb378a4570", "type": "group" }
      },
      "properties": {
        "data": [
          { "id": "acb388d9-546b-42fc-9ae2-baf00e7f0d8c", "type": "property" }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Note that the connection **starts disabled**: `is_active` in the create payload has no effect — a new connection is always created with `is_active: false`. Activation is a separate, explicit step.

Only one connection per Mr & Mrs Smith `hotel_id` is allowed on Channex.

### 7. Activate the connection

```
POST /api/v1/channels/{channel_id}/activate
```

No payload. Activation requires the connection to have at least one property and at least one rate plan mapping; activating starts the synchronization — Channex pushes the full current availability, rates and restrictions to Mr & Mrs Smith and begins receiving bookings.

The counterpart is `POST /api/v1/channels/{channel_id}/deactivate`, which stops the synchronization but keeps the connection and its mappings.

### Updating a connection

```
PUT /api/v1/channels/{channel_id}
```

The payload has the same shape as for create (wrapped in `channel`). Two rules matter:

* **`channel` cannot be changed** — a different adapter code is rejected.
* **`rate_plans`, when present, replaces the whole mapping set.** A stored mapping missing from the list is removed, and a mapping sent with `settings: null` is removed as well. Omit `rate_plans` entirely to keep the stored mappings.

### Deleting a connection

```
DELETE /api/v1/channels/{channel_id}
```

An active connection must be deactivated first. Deleting removes the connection and all its mappings; bookings received through it are kept.

### Actions

The Mr & Mrs Smith adapter declares no connection actions — `actions` is empty on the descriptor and on every Mr & Mrs Smith connection.

### Mr & Mrs Smith settings reference

The full set of connection `settings` for Mr & Mrs Smith:

| Setting                    | Description                                                                                                                                                     |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `hotel_id`                 | The Mr & Mrs Smith Hotel ID. Required.                                                                                                                          |
| `email`                    | The email address the notifications go to.                                                                                                                      |
| `send_email_notifications` | When `true`, Channex sends a notification about each booking.                                                                                                   |
| `max_stay_type`            | How the maximum stay restriction is applied: `Arrival` (counted from the arrival date) or `Through` (applied to every stayed-through date). Default `Arrival`.  |
| `booking_amount_settings`  | Which amount is recorded as the booking total: `Gross Amount` (including the Mr & Mrs Smith commission) or `Net Amount` (excluding it). Default `Gross Amount`. |
