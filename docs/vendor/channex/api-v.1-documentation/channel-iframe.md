# Channel IFrame

## Generate a One-Time access token

To generate a One-Time access token you should call the next API Method:

```
POST {{server}}/api/v1/auth/one_time_token

{
  "one_time_token": {
    "property_id": "ACCESSIBLE_PROPERTY_ID",
    "group_id": "ACCESSIBLE_GROUP_ID",
    "username": "USERNAME"
  }
}

```

property\_id: This is the channex property ID the user should get access to

group\_id: This is the channex group ID the user should get access to (optional)

username: This should be the name of the user that is logged into your PMS system

You should get the following response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "token": "94feab9f-60e6-411b-d854-8f12004d8bc8"
  },
  "meta": {
    "message": "You are successfully received one-time token! Use it for exchange to JWT"
  }
}
```

At data.token you should receive a One-Time access token to authorise your user in Channex without providing credentials.

After the first usage, token will be removed. The token will live for 15 minutes. Once iframe loaded it will not have an expiry time.

The user will be authenticated under the same user, who requested the Access Token!

## Generate the Iframe Code

The next step is to generate the iframe to show to your user

```
<iframe src="{{server}}/auth/exchange?oauth_session_key={{ONE_TIME_ACCESS_TOKEN}}&app_mode=headless&redirect_to=/channels&property_id={{PROPERTY_ID}}"></iframe>
```

\
Where `{{server}}` is the address of the Channex server, `{{ONE_TIME_ACCESS_TOKEN}}` is the token received at the previous step, `{{PROPERTY_ID}}` is the ID of the Property in Channex which will be associated with the created channels.

Channex also support `group_id` argument at URL, to correctly setup required Group for new channel.

### Filter available channels

To allow user connect only specific channels, you can pass additional argument `channels` inside URL:

```
{{server}}/auth/exchange?oauth_session_key={{ONE_TIME_ACCESS_TOKEN}}&app_mode=headless&redirect_to=/channels&property_id={{PROPERTY_ID}}&channels=BDC,ABB
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
This filter have 2 side effects:

* filter represented channels at list of channels
* allow user to setup only Channels provided at this list

If you would like to control this behavior separately, please take a look into `available_channels` and `channels_filter` options.
{% endhint %}

To filter channels what will be represented at Channel List, please apply `channels_filter`.

To filter channels what will be available for connection, please apply `available_channels`.

## IFrame functionality flags

To simplify UI and decrease complexity for clients who will work with Channex IFrame we hide some functionality from embedded mode. But you still able to enable that functionality by pass flags as part of URL.

**Allow Notifications Edit**

At Channel Management dialog we have a settings to enable / disable Property Booking Notifications. Because most of PMS use they own mailing system we hide that settings at Embedded mode. But if you would like to allow client to make decision about that option, please add GET Argument `allow_notifications_edit=true` into URL when embed IFrame.

#### Language

By pass `lng=XX` you can choose a language for IFrame UI.\
Right now we support next languages:

* English (`en`)
* Portuguese (`pt`)
* Spanish (`es`)
* Russian (`ru`)
* German (`de`)
* Greek (`el`)
* Italian (`it`)
* Hungarian (`hu`)
* Thai (`th`)

If you are interested at new translation, please let us know by email.

#### **Allow open bookings from Message UI**

By pass `messages_show_booking=true` you can control visibility of Open Booking button at Messages screen.

#### Read Only Availability for Inventory Screen

By pass `read_only_availability=true` you can block editing Availability at Inventory screen.

#### Hide Upload Attachment button for Messages UI

By pass `hide_messages_attach_btn=true` you can hide "Upload Attachment" button at Messages UI.

## Notes

The provided iframe UI is limited and only allows the user to create / edit / remove channels with the provided Property ID.

There is no access policy yet for example “Read-Only” mode. Let us know your ideas or requirements if that is needed.

## Other Pages from Channex

This API will allow you to iframe any page from Channex, you will need to edit the redirect. All pages will generally work with property ID option.

Example to get messages page:

```
{{server}}/auth/exchange?oauth_session_key={{ONE_TIME_ACCESS_TOKEN}}&app_mode=headless&redirect_to=/messages&property_id={{PROPERTY_ID}}
```

### Messages Page

As mentioned before, you are able to open any page of Channex via IFrame and our Applications can work with this manner too.

To open Messages, you should redirect user to `/messages` page.

#### Open Messages for specific Booking

Messages page can be opened at Message Thread for a specific Booking. But to do that, you should to know Message Thread ID from Booking.

As a first step, you should request a Booking from Channex side via API (<https://docs.channex.io/api-v.1-documentation/bookings-collection#get-booking-by-id>), where at answer you will find a `message_thread_id` at `relationships.message_thread.data.id`.

This `message_thread_id` should be used at redirect URL `messages/{{message_thread_id}}`. So, as result, application will be loaded at page with Messages for requested booking.
