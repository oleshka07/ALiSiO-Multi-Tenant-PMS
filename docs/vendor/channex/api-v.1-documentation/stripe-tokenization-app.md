# Stripe Tokenization App

A lot of our customers use Stripe to charge guests and transfer money to Properties. It is excellent solution and works well without any headache except one - how to transfer Credit Card details from OTA to Stripe account. Usually, to perform this operation your system should be PCI DSS certified, because this operation required access to Raw Credit Card data.

Channex will offer a new way how to do that and dramatically decrease complexity - Stripe Tokenization App.

Basically, this Application allow you to do just one thing - pass Credit Card data from Channex PCI Storage into your Stripe Account.

To work with this API you should have:

* connected PMS Stripe Account (you can do that at your User Profile)
* installed Stripe Tokenization App (see [Applications API](/api-v.1-documentation/applications-api.md))

When Stripe is connected and Application is installed, you will have access to two API methods:

* Create Credit Card Stripe Token
* Create Payment Method Token

## Connect PMS Stripe Account

Login into system as PMS Account Owner and open User Profile.

At User Profile page you will see section "Stripe Connection" with "Connect" button. Please, go over oAuth process at Stripe side.
