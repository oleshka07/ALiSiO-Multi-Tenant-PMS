# Bookings Collection

At Channex we have several different methods to work with **Bookings**, such as List of Bookings, Booking Revision Feed and etc.

Each Booking at Channex is a representation of latest known Booking Revision, where Booking Revision is parsed and normalised message from OTA.

If you would like build a PMS integration, you should use the [Booking Revision Feed API](#booking-revisions-feed), to fetch booking messages and modify bookings at your side. For initial pull, you can use Booking List API or Booking Revision Feed.

## Reporting API

Reporting API can be used to notify OTA about some problems with current booking. At this time, we support Booking.com Reporting API (No Show, Invalid Card, Cancel Due Invalid Card).

### No Show Report API

You can mark a reservation as a no-show from 00:00 (midnight, in property's local time) on the planned check-in date, up to 48 hours later, provided that:

* the status of the reservation allows modifications;
* the reservation isn't overbooked.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Booking.com Request" %}

```

Payload:

```
{
  "no_show_report": {
    "waived_fees": boolean
  }
}

`waived_fees` specifies whether the property will waive the [no-show](https://connect.booking.com/user_guide/site/en-US/reporting-api/b_xml-reporting/#report-guest-no-show) fees. Can be `true` or `false`

### Cancel Due Invalid Card Report API

A property may cancel a reservation if the guest's credit card details are invalid and certain conditions are met:

**- If you don’t receive updated credit card details** within 24 hours, or the guest provides invalid credit card details again.

**- For bookings made within 48 hours of check-in**, if the card is invalid, the customer will have 12 hours (or until 3 pm – whichever is earlier) to update these details (instead of the usual 24 hours).

**- The customer is always given at least 2 hours to update these details** (i.e. if the booking is made after 2 pm on the day of arrival).

**- For last-minute bookings of 10 or more room nights,** partners can cancel 2 hours after marking the credit as invalid.
